# Teleport Upgrade Ansible



## Description

The **Teleport Upgrade Ansible** repository is a collection of Ansible playbooks and roles designed to facilitate the upgrade process of [Teleport](https://gravitational.com/teleport/) clusters. Teleport is an open-source, secure access solution that provides unified access to SSH servers, Kubernetes clusters, and web applications. 

This repository aims to simplify and automate the process of upgrading a Teleport cluster to newer versions by providing a set of reusable Ansible playbooks. Ansible is a powerful automation tool that allows system administrators to define and manage infrastructure as code.

## Features

- **Upgrade Automation:** The repository includes Ansible playbooks and roles specifically designed to automate the upgrade process of a Teleport cluster. This helps minimize manual intervention and reduces the risk of errors during the upgrade process.

- **Version Compatibility:** The playbooks are designed to support different versions of Teleport, ensuring that the upgrade process is smooth and seamless. The repository is regularly updated to accommodate new Teleport releases and their corresponding upgrade requirements.

- **Flexible Configuration:** The Ansible playbooks are highly customizable, allowing administrators to tailor the upgrade process to their specific requirements. Configuration variables and options are provided, enabling users to define settings such as backup strategies, upgrade paths, and cluster-specific configurations.

## Usage

To use the playbooks and roles provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/paradoxe35/teleport-upgrade-ansible.git
   ```

2. Configure the necessary variables and options in the playbooks to match your Teleport cluster's environment and upgrade requirements.

3. Execute the desired playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command, specifying the playbook file:

   ```
   ansible-playbook upgrade.yml
   ```

   This will start the upgrade process on the targeted Teleport cluster nodes.
